## Project Description
- **Visualization:** https://public.tableau.com/views/FinalProject_17151090589020/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
- **Question:** How does the sale of alcohol vary by geographical location? What are the other key factors that influence the sale of alcohol?
- **Importance:** When devising ways to understand alcohol's importance and impact on the world, we can dive into several more in-depth sections. The first topic that comes to mind is cultural differences. Some countries have varying attitudes toward alcohol consumption. Bringing awareness through visualizations displaying areas that may be more sensitive to people or tourists consuming alcohol could help prevent future incidents from occurring. Secondly, being that alcohol is a poison, health implications go hand in hand with it. Through the use of visualizations, specific areas that may be susceptible to having higher alcohol consumption patterns can receive more support and intervention and recovery programs. Next, remember to account for the legal and regulatory considerations. A better understanding of the local laws and regulations could be crucial for compliance in the area. Moving forward into the social and economic implications of alcohol and its impact across the globe. Some cities and regions that are more relaxed about their alcohol consumption policy have a lower productivity level and a higher burden on the medical system, which can be seen through several visualizations. Finally, the last topic of discussion will be the relationship between alcohol tourism and travel. We can show through alcohol sales in certain regions how sales would be higher at specific tourist destinations. With all of these reasons, through visualizations, we can show how alcohol sales can change around the world, given these factors.


## Data Description

**Data Instructions:** 
  - Our data can be downloaded from Data World. The link below is a direct path to the data file we used to make our three visualizations.

**Columns:**
  
  - Country: this column includes all the countries involved in the curvy
  
  - Beer_Servings: average servings of beer per person
  
  - Spirit_Servings: average servings of spirits per person
  
  - Wine_Servings: average servings of wine per person
  
  - Total_Litres_of_Pure_Alcohol: Average liters of pure alcohol per person

## Visualizations
- **Visualization One - Bar Chat:** The bar chart accurately depicts the highest mean average of wine drinkers. According to our data set, it progressively decreases as you progress across the chart for the top 25 wine-drinking countries. This gives insight into wine sales specifically and could be used by wineries to target new markets. The countries at the top of the list have cultures that heavily drink wine. Therefore, this visualization can help businesses find or focus on some areas of the world.

- **Visualization Two - Heat Map:** The heat map shows the amount of alcohol consumed by each region. We used a function to combine beer, wine, and spirits. If you pay attention to the prominent religions across specific areas, you’ll see how certain religions are more lenient or strict based on their religious consumption philosophy. This has much to do with cultural practices, religion, and government regulations. For example, much of Africa and the Middle East don’t drink alcohol at all. This is because many of the country's religions forbid alcohol. This visualization gives a better idea of how different regions consume all types of alcohol.

- **Visualization Three — Tree Map:** The third visualization shows beer consumption as a tree map. In the first column, five countries are from Europe, showing a bias that countries located there are more relaxed about their alcohol policies. Similar to the first visualization, this shows how beer consumption is more significant in some areas than others. Many of the top consumers are located in Europe. We know this is because drinking is a big part of their culture.
