## Project Description
- **Visualization:** https://public.tableau.com/views/FinalProject_17151090589020/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
- **Question:** How does the sale of alcohol vary by geographical location? What are the other key factors that influence the sale of alcohol?
- **Importance:** When devising ways to understand alcohol's importance and impact on the world, we can dive into several more in-depth sections. The first topic that comes to mind is cultural differences. Some countries have varying attitudes toward alcohol consumption. Bringing awareness through visualizations displaying areas that may be more sensitive to people or tourists consuming alcohol could help prevent future incidents from occurring. Secondly, being that alcohol is a poison, health implications go hand in hand with it. Through the use of visualizations, specific areas that may be susceptible to having higher alcohol consumption patterns can receive more support and intervention and recovery programs. Next, remember to account for the legal and regulatory considerations. A better understanding of the local laws and regulations could be crucial for compliance in the area. Moving forward into the social and economic implications of alcohol and its impact across the globe. Some cities and regions that are more relaxed about their alcohol consumption policy have a lower productivity level and a higher burden on the medical system, which can be seen through several visualizations. Finally, the last topic of discussion will be the relationship between alcohol tourism and travel. We can show through alcohol sales in certain regions how sales would be higher at specific tourist destinations. With all of these reasons, through visualizations, we can show how alcohol sales can change around the world, given these factors.


## Data Description

## Visualizations
- **Visualization One - Bar Chat:** The bar chart accurately depicts the highest mean average of wine drinkers. According to our data set, it progressively decreases as you progress across the chart for the top 25 wine-drinking countries. This gives insight into wine sales specifically and could be used by wineries to target new markets. The countries at the top of the list have cultures that heavily drink wine. Therefore, this visualization can help businesses find or focus on some areas of the world.

- **Visualization Two - Heat Map:** The heat map shows the amount of alcohol consumed by each region. We used a function to combine beer, wine, and spirits. If you pay attention to the prominent religions across specific areas, you’ll see how certain religions are more lenient or strict based on their religious consumption philosophy. This has much to do with cultural practices, religion, and government regulations. For example, much of Africa and the Middle East don’t drink alcohol at all. This is because many of the country's religions forbid alcohol. This visualization gives a better idea of how different regions consume all types of alcohol.

- **Visualization Three — Tree Map:** The third visualization shows beer consumption as a tree map. In the first column, five countries are from Europe, showing a bias that countries located there are more relaxed about their alcohol policies. Similar to the first visualization, this shows how beer consumption is more significant in some areas than others. Many of the top consumers are located in Europe. We know this is because drinking is a big part of their culture.

## Discussion & Summary

- **Article:** https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption
- **Summary:** The article from "Our World in Data" provides an in-depth study of global trends in alcohol consumption by drawing on a variety of sources. It clarifies the huge range of alcohol consumption levels noted in various nations and areas around the world. Interestingly, countries in Eastern Europe are emphasized for having higher per capita alcohol use than Middle Eastern countries, where lower rates of alcohol consumption are frequently attributed to cultural and religious issues. Additionally, the paper explores how changes in social norms, urbanization, and economic growth affect drinking patterns and how dynamic alcohol consumption trends are over time. It talks about variations in alcohol intake within particular nations, which are frequently caused by adjustments to governmental regulations or public health campaigns targeted at excessive drinking. The long-term health hazards associated with alcohol use, such as liver disease, cancer, and cardiovascular issues, as well as the immediate effects, such as accidents and injuries, are well-researched. Diverse demographic groups' differences in alcohol-related health outcomes are also examined, emphasizing the necessity for focused treatments. The essay discusses concerns related to alcohol usage that go beyond health consequences, including crime, violence, and social inequality. It examines the financial toll that alcohol abuse takes, as well as the difficulties in controlling the distribution and marketing of alcohol. A thorough discussion of policy interventions—which include public health campaigns, minimum drinking age regulations, taxes, and advertising restrictions—is devoted to reducing the harm caused by alcohol. Empirical data from several nations is used to assess the efficacy of these treatments, offering insightful information about the best ways to implement alcohol laws. Overall, the paper provides a sophisticated knowledge of the complex variables affecting worldwide patterns of alcohol use while emphasizing the value of evidence-based strategies in resolving the related social and health issues.
- **Asking Our Question to ChatGPT:**
  
The sale of alcohol varies significantly by geographical location, with notable differences observed between regions and countries. Eastern European nations, for example, often have higher per capita alcohol consumption rates compared to countries in the Middle East, where cultural and religious factors contribute to lower alcohol consumption levels. Additionally, within countries, urban areas tend to have higher alcohol sales compared to rural areas, reflecting differences in lifestyle, social norms, and access to alcohol outlets.

Several key factors influence the sale of alcohol:

  - Cultural and Religious Norms: Cultural attitudes towards alcohol consumption vary widely across different societies. In some cultures, alcohol may be an integral part of social and religious ceremonies, leading to higher consumption levels. Conversely, in regions where religious beliefs prohibit or discourage alcohol consumption, sales may be lower.
  - Economic Factors: Economic development plays a significant role in alcohol sales, with higher-income countries generally exhibiting higher levels of consumption. This relationship is attributed to increased disposable income, greater availability of alcohol products, and shifts in consumer preferences towards premium or imported beverages.
Government Policies and Regulations: Alcohol sales are heavily influenced by government policies and regulations, including taxation, minimum drinking age laws, licensing requirements, and restrictions on advertising and marketing. Countries with stricter alcohol regulations often have lower alcohol sales, as these measures are designed to reduce alcohol-related harm and promote public health.
  - Social and Demographic Factors: Social and demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, education, and marital status, also influence alcohol sales. For instance, young adults and men typically have higher rates of alcohol consumption compared to older adults and women. Moreover, educational attainment and marital status can impact drinking behavior, with higher levels of education and stable relationships often associated with lower alcohol consumption.
  - Health Awareness and Public Health Campaigns: Public health campaigns and initiatives aimed at raising awareness about the health risks associated with alcohol consumption can influence sales by changing consumer attitudes and behavior. These campaigns may encourage moderation, responsible drinking, and seeking help for alcohol-related problems, thereby potentially reducing overall alcohol sales.

In summary, the sale of alcohol varies geographically due to a complex interplay of cultural, economic, regulatory, social, and health-related factors. Understanding these influences is crucial for designing effective interventions to address alcohol-related harms and promote public health
